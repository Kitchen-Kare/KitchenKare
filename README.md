# Kitchen Kare

STEM II is a group engineering project that Mass Academy students complete during D term of junior year. My group, STEMgineers, consisted of myself, Ronit Avadhuta, Kate Connoni, and Rachel Haynes.

Elderly or disabled people often have trouble using kitchen appliances safely due to not being able to see, hear, or remember well. More specifically, clients have issues with stove and oven safety. In fact, this causes fire-related injuries and harms which is the third leading cause of death for the elderly (Agesafe, 2017). For example, they may not be aware of water that is boiling or that they left the stove or oven on. The dangers that the elderly and disabled face in the kitchen prevent them from independence and put their safety at risk. The goal of this project is to create a device targeted towards the elderly and disabled, specifically those with vision, hearing, or memory loss, to alert them of a stove or oven left working.
